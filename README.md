# 📜 Configuration Management & Server Hardening (Ansible)

This repository serves as the "System Administrator" for our AWS infrastructure. While Terraform builds the hardware, this Ansible suite automates the complex software layering required to turn blank Ubuntu instances into a fully functional **Jenkins Master** and a **Production-Ready Docker Host**.

## ⚡ The Automation Power

* **Zero-Touch Provisioning**: Configures Java, Jenkins, Docker, and Security settings without a single manual SSH command.
* **Idempotency**: Playbooks can be run multiple times safely; Ansible only makes changes if the system is not in the desired state.
* **Role-Based Architecture**: Modular design separating Jenkins logic from Docker logic for maximum reusability.

## 🛠️ Configuration Scope

### **Node 1: Jenkins CI Master**

* Installs **OpenJDK 11** (Required for Jenkins).
* Automates **Jenkins LTS** repository setup and installation.
* Ensures the Jenkins service is started and enabled on boot.
* Configures firewall rules for port `8080`.

### **Node 2: Docker App Host**

* Performs system updates and installs dependencies.
* Installs **Docker Engine** and **Docker Compose**.
* **User Permissioning**: Automatically adds the `ubuntu` user to the `docker` group to enable seamless CI/CD execution via Jenkins agents.
* Cleans up legacy containers to ensure a fresh deployment environment.

## 📂 Project Structure

```text
├── inventory.ini      # Server IP addresses from Terraform outputs
├── site.yml           # Main entry point (The "Master Playbook")
├── ansible.cfg        # Optimized Ansible performance settings
└── roles/
    ├── jenkins/       # Logic for the CI Master
    └── docker/        # Logic for the Deployment Host

```

## 🚀 How to Execute

1. **Prepare Inventory**:
Update `inventory.ini` with the Public IPs generated by Terraform.
```ini
[jenkins_master]
1.2.3.4
[app_host]
5.6.7.8

```


2. **Verify Connectivity**:
```bash
ansible all -m ping -i inventory.ini

```


3. **Run the Orchestration**:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini site.yml

```



## ✅ End Result
After execution, your environment is ready for the Final Stage: The Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline, where the Node.js application is built, containerized, and deployed.
